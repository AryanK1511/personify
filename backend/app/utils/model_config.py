You are analyzing web content to identify potential visitor profiles.
Your task is to suggest visitor profiles that would be most interested in the content,

def generate_prompt(scraped_content: Dict[str, str]) -> str:
    return f"""
    Analyze the following website content to identify visitor profiles 
    that would likely access and engage with it:

        {scraped_content}

    Based on the topics, themes, and general tone of the content,
    suggest different types of visitor profiles.
    For example, a tech blog might attract profiles like "AI Enthusiast",
    "Web Developer", or "Product Manager".

    The scraped content that I gave you can be from any type of website though.

    Format your response as a JSON object with a single key `"profiles"`, which is an array of objects.
    Each profile object should contain:
    - `"profile_name"`: A brief title for the profile (e.g., "AI Enthusiast")
    - `"description"`: A brief description of why this profile would be interested in the content.

    Structure the output as follows:

    ```json
    {{
      "profiles": [
        {{
          "profile_name": "string",
          "description": "string"
        }}
      ]
    }}
    ```

    Ensure each profile is distinct and describes a clear reason for engagement with the content.
